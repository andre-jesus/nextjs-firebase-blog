4. Need to create reusable components for consistent UI elements
5. Mobile responsiveness needs further testing and refinement
6. Missing error handling for various API calls
7. Need to implement proper loading states for better UX

## Next Focus Areas

1. Complete the venue profile pages
2. Implement actual map integration with Mapbox/Google Maps
3. Build check-in functionality for events
4. Create user profile page with saved events section
5. Develop social connections between users

## Resources Needed
