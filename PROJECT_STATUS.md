# Project Status: NextJS Firebase Blog / Happen App

## Current Status (April 5, 2025)

We have just fixed several critical permission issues in the application related to venue management and event creation:

1. **Venue Profile Editing** - Resolved "Missing or insufficient permissions" error when venue managers attempted to edit their venue profiles by:
   - Updating Firestore rules to be more flexible about ownership verification
   - Improving the venue update logic to properly handle ownership context
   - Adding user context to the venue update process

2. **Event Creation** - Fixed permission issues when creating events associated with venues by:
   - Adding an `organizerId` field to event creation to clarify permissions
   - Updating Firestore rules to allow updates from venue owners or event creators
   - Making the event creation process more robust with proper authentication checks

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority

1. **Analytics Page** - Continue development on the analytics dashboard for venue owners
   - Implement charts and data visualization
   - Connect to actual event and venue data
   - Add filtering options

2. **Venue Dashboard Features** - Complete implementation of venue management tools:
   - Event management dashboard
   - Venue analytics
   - Attendee management
   - Review management

3. **User Account Type Selection** - Fine-tune the login flow to allow users to select their account type

### Medium Priority

1. **Map View for Discovery** - Enhance the map view for regular users to discover events and venues
2. **Conditional Navigation** - Complete implementation of different navigation menus based on account type
3. **Mobile Responsive Design** - Ensure full compatibility across different screen sizes

### Low Priority

1. **Performance Optimization** - Implement more efficient queries and data caching
2. **Social Features** - Add additional social interaction capabilities
3. **Testing** - Expand test coverage for critical user flows

## Implementation Notes

- All Firebase security rules have been updated to properly handle permissions
- The venue update process now correctly preserves ownership information
- Event creation now properly sets both creator and organizer IDs
- The user type is stored in the user profile for conditional rendering

## Next Steps

1. Continue work on the analytics page as previously planned
2. Complete the venue dashboard features
3. Test venue profile editing and event creation to confirm fixes
4. Implement remaining user flow features according to USER_FLOW_PLAN.md
